# PlusBit POS
PlusBit is designed for merchants to be able to accept cryptocurrencies quickly, easily, and securely. In order to further adoption of cryptocurrency we need to make it easy for merchants to accept it as a form of payment. This system will enable them to do so.

For merchants, using a wallet to accept coins is NOT a good solution. First of all, you don’t want co-workers to have access to wallets so you will want a receive only option. PlusBit offers this solution. It is a fully non-custodial, easy to set up and charges no fees… You are the only person to have 100% control over your or your company’s funds. PlusBit only generates the payment requests to a wallet that the merchant controls on a different machine. This means that there is no control of the coins from the POS software. This situation works especially well when you have employees that may access this machine as well. 

With PlusBit, your keys and funds remain in your control at all times. Your private keys never need to be entered into PlusBit. That makes using Plusbit pretty safe. Nobody will have access to any of the funds you receive at any time.

One of the other reasons a merchant would use this app over the standard mobile wallet would be to have an experience they are familiar with. It has been designed to be very closely related to credit card processing machines in this respect.

You don't need to wait wallet sync.
